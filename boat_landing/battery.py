"""Battery drain model.

Charge runs from 1.0 (full) to 0.0 (depleted). Two contributions:

    base drain:        constant rate (`battery_drain_rate`, units: 1/sec)
    aggressive drain:  proportional to body angular-velocity magnitude,
                       scaled by `battery_drain_aggressive`

The intent is to penalize agents that thrash the attitude controller —
realistic-ish, since high angular rates correlate with high thrust demands.
