"""Drone-sim similarity check.

When the simulator score is computed, the participant's `drone_sim.py`
is compared against a set of "trusted reference" files to detect
verbatim resubmissions. Used by `evaluation/sim_scorer.py`.

What this catches
-----------------
- Submitting `agents/drone_sim_baseline.py` unmodified (the public
  starter kit).
- Submitting the baseline with cosmetic changes only (comments removed,
  docstrings reflowed, whitespace normalised, variable renamed
  consistently).

What this does NOT catch
------------------------
- The participant rewrote the sim from scratch in their own style
  but happened to land on a similar AST shape. By design — that's
  honest engineering, not copying.
- The participant translated the binary reference sim back into Python
  via reverse engineering. The binary distribution and the no-RE
  policy (see CHALLENGE.md) push that path beyond useful effort; we
  rely on policy + organiser review for that, not on this check.

Match policy
------------
A submission whose AST is identical to any reference (after the
normalisation below) is *flagged* and capped at 0 sim-track points.
Below the cap, no further penalty is applied — partial similarity is
treated as a code-review signal, not a hard fail.
