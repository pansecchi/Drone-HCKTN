"""T1.F — Ground effect (thrust amplification near a surface).

Verify the simulator amplifies rotor thrust when the drone is close to
a ground surface, the way real rotorcraft do due to air recirculation.

Physical model (Cheng-Frantz approximation, the textbook starting point):
    T_eff = T * (1 + a * (R / h)^2),      with R = rotor radius,
                                          h = altitude above surface,
                                          a ≈ 0.10-0.50 (literature range)

Test:
    1. Reset the drone exactly one rotor diameter (h = R) above a
       virtual ground surface at z = `GROUND_Z` (chosen to match the
       env's platform top, ~0.5 m).
    2. Apply the analytic hover throttle — i.e. the throttle that
       balances mg for the FREE-FLIGHT thrust calculation.
    3. Pass `ext_ground_z = GROUND_Z` to every `step()` call so the sim
       knows where the surface is.
    4. Integrate for 0.5 s.

Without ground effect: T = mg exactly, so the drone hovers (Δz ≈ 0).
With ground effect: T_eff > mg at h = R, so the drone climbs measurably.

Pass criterion: vertical drift > 5 cm in 0.5 s. With a = 0.05 and h = R
the multiplier is 1.05 → excess upward acceleration ≈ 0.05g ≈ 0.49 m/s²
→ Δz ≈ 0.5 · 0.49 · 0.5² ≈ 6 cm, comfortably above the threshold. A
sim that ignores `ext_ground_z` produces Δz ≈ 0 and fails the test.

This test is intentionally indifferent to the specific formula used —
it only checks that some altitude-dependent thrust amplification is
applied when the simulator receives `ext_ground_z`.
