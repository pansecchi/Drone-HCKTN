"""T1.B — Battery voltage sag under sustained load.

Verify the simulator models the battery's internal resistance: under
sustained high-power demand (full throttle), the achievable max RPM
should drop measurably as battery voltage sags below nominal.

Test:
    1. Reset and let the sim settle to hover briefly.
    2. Command full throttle for 20 s straight (continuous load).
    3. Measure the steady-state motor omega at the end.
    4. Compare to omega_max from the spec.

Pass criterion: omega_after_sustained_load / omega_max < 0.95. That is,
sustained max throttle reduces the achievable RPM by more than 5%.

This test is loose because individual sims will model sag with very
different aggressiveness depending on `battery.internal_resistance`,
how they relate voltage to omega_max (V/Kv), and whether they model
discharge curves. Anything noticeable beyond instantaneous full RPM is
accepted.

Requires `state.motor_omegas` to be exposed.
