"""T1.E — Internal sub-stepping (numerical-integration robustness).

Verify the simulator integrates with sufficient internal resolution to
handle a coarse outer dt without significant error growth.

Test:
    1. Run sim_a for one outer step of dt = 0.02 s with a stiff
       command profile (full throttle ramp).
    2. Run sim_b for 5 outer steps of dt = 0.004 s with the same
       commands (so 5× higher cadence on the integrator).
    3. Compare final positions / velocities.

If the sim sub-steps internally (e.g. breaks dt = 0.02 into 5 or more
sub-steps of 0.004 s or finer), both runs should converge to nearly
the same result. If the sim does ONE Euler step regardless of dt size,
the dt=0.02 run will accumulate noticeably more integration error.

Pass criterion: the position difference between the two runs is below
2 cm. The threshold is loose so that single-Euler-step sims fail
clearly while well-integrated sims pass with margin.

This test exists to reward sims that handle the full env physics rate
(250 Hz) AND additionally sub-step the stiff motor dynamics internally,
without forcing a specific implementation strategy.
