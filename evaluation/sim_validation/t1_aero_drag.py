"""T1.C — Aerodynamic drag (linear and/or quadratic).

Verify the simulator applies a body-velocity-dependent drag force
distinguishable from the no-drag (vacuum) reference.

Test:
    1. Reset at altitude with zero velocity, level attitude.
    2. Command zero throttle (free fall).
    3. Integrate for 4 s.
    4. Compare measured downward velocity to the analytic no-drag
       value v_no_drag = -g * t = -39.24 m/s.

Pass criterion:
    |measured - v_no_drag| / |v_no_drag|  >  0.02
That is, drag must slow the fall by more than 2% relative to vacuum.

Why this works: with zero throttle, no thrust at steady-state, no wind,
the only forces are gravity (always present) and drag (the feature under
test). If `aero.drag_*` are zero or unused, the sim matches free-fall
within the small residual motor-spin-down impulse. If drag is active,
the measured velocity at 4 s is strictly less in magnitude.

The 4 s duration is chosen so the (mostly-fixed) residual impulse from
the first-order motor decay during the first ~0.5 s amortises below the
2 % threshold, while a real drag force keeps growing with |v|. A sim
that resets motors to hover RPM (the baseline does, to pass T0.2) will
not falsely pass this test thanks to the long enough window.

NB: this test does NOT verify the drag formula is correct, only that
SOME velocity-dependent damping is applied.
